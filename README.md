WSO2 Micro Integrator is the integration runtime of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator
(EI), which is an open-source, hybrid integration platform. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/overview/introduction/) for further information. 

The Micro Integrator runtime is lightweight, fast, scalable, and supports centralized ESB-style integration architectures as well as decentralized microservices architectures:

-   Decentralized integration architecture

Developers can create integrations graphically by using [WSO2 Integration Studio](https://wso2.com/integration/integration-studio/) and deploy them in the Micro Integrator runtime.

## Why Micro Integrator?

The Micro Integrator provides developers with a flawless experience in developing, testing, and deploying integration solutions. The Micro Integrator developer experience is especially tuned for;
-   Integration developers who prefer a config-driven approach to integration (centralized or decentralized).
-   Integration developers who are looking for a solution to integrate brownfield (i.e.  legacy systems) solutions with new microservices-based solutions.
-   Existing WSO2 EI and integration middleware users who want to move into cloud-native or microservices architectures.

The Micro Integrator offers an enhanced experience for container-based architectures by simplifying Docker/Kubernetes deployments. 

Refer the [developer guide](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/intro-integration-development/) in the documentation for details.
